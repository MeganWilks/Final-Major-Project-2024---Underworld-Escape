# Final-Major-Project-2024---Underworld-Escape
This is my Final Major project from Level 3 Year 1 Games Development with a theme of Mythology and I created a game called Underworld Escape. To be able to add this game into your Unity you will need to create a 2D Unity Project and then make sure you add a ground layer so the player doesn't fall through the platformer. My prpject includes 2D Movement, Jump pads, Animations, Collectibles, UI menus and much more!
